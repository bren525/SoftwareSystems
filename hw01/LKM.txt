4) Turn off the integral term by setting ki to 0.  What is the qualitative effect on the behavior of the system?  What is the effect on RMS error?
Visibly more difficient (doesn't quite reach quota)
slightly more variant (random)

5) Modify setpoint so that instead of jumping up and then down, it increases gradually over time.  How does the system perform with this kind of setpoint behavior?
Follows the trend more closely, not thrown off by sudden changes

6) Add a derivative term and adjust the gain to minimize RMS.  For the gradually increasing setpoint, is the best PID controller better than the best PI controller?
initital tests shows my kd of .1 - .12 shows best RMS. ki of .01 (given) shows equal bests, but seems much more volatile in terms of RMS.
Optimized values together show the best overall scores AND the most consistency.
